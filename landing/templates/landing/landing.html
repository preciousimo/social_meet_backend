      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Using the Social Meet Backend API is straightforward and can be integrated into your application with ease. Here are the steps to get started:</p>
  
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Before making API requests, you need to obtain an API key. To authenticate your requests, include the API key in the headers of each request.</li>
        
        <li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong> The API offers various endpoints for different functionalities. Refer to the API documentation for a detailed list of available endpoints, request methods, and expected responses.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Request Format:</strong> Construct your API requests using the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and include the necessary parameters and headers. Ensure the request format aligns with the API documentation to receive accurate responses.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Response Handling:</strong> Handle API responses based on the provided status codes and response data. Error handling is crucial to address any issues encountered during API interactions. The API documentation specifies the expected response formats and error handling guidelines.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Testing and Development:</strong> During the testing and development phase, utilize tools such as Postman or cURL to send requests to the API endpoints. This allows you to verify functionality, debug any issues, and ensure proper integration with your application.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Scalability and Optimization:</strong> As your application grows, consider implementing caching mechanisms, optimizing database queries, and leveraging other performance-enhancing techniques to ensure smooth API interactions and handle increased user traffic.</li>
      </ol>
